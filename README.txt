The site is created with the following technologies:
   - HTML5
   - SASS
   - JavaScript

For running the code locally, just copy the repository and open the project in text editor tool (i.e Visual Studio Code). For changing the stylesheet you would need Sass compiler to compile the stylesheet. Remember: do not change style.css file. All changes should be done in files with .sass extension.
